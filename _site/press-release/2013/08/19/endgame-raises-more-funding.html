		<h2 id='endgame_inc_raises_23m_series_b_round_of_equity_financing'>Endgame, Inc. Raises $23M Series B Round of Equity Financing</h2>

<p><em>Herndon, VA</em> — March 13, 2013— Endgame, Inc., a leading provider of battle-tested cyber security solutions, announced today that it has closed a $23 million Series B equity financing to fund growth in its existing federal customer base as well as expansion into the commercial market.</p>

<p>Led by new investor Paladin Capital Group, a multi-stage private equity firm providing capital and strategic guidance to growing companies, the Series B includes participation from existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Columbia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &amp; Byers and TechOperators. Lt. General (Ret) Kenneth A. Minihan, former Director of the National Security Agency and Managing Director at Paladin, will join the Endgame Board of Directors.</p>

<p>“The cyber domain will be increasingly important across all dimensions of national power – military, economic, and informational,” said Lt. General Minihan. “Endgame’s revolutionary technology allows its customers to use intelligence seamlessly to gain situational awareness and support their end-to-end network operations.”</p>

<p>As part of its expansion, Endgame has recruited several new executives to the company&#8217;s management team, including: Nathaniel Fick, who joined as CEO in November, replacing Chris Rouland who remains a Founder and board member of the company; Niloofar Howe, who joined as Chief Strategy Officer to lead the company&#8217;s efforts in market and product strategy, as well as business and corporate development; and Matt Georgy, who joined Endgame as CTO after a decorated career as a senior executive at the Department of Defense supporting all aspects of computer network operations. Endgame&#8217;s new Chairman of the Board, Christopher Darby, has deep expertise in the intelligence space as the current President and CEO of In-Q-Tel, the independent strategic investment firm supporting the missions of the U.S. Intelligence Community. “The cyber needs of federal and commercial entities are converging as states look beyond targeting other states to target private companies, and national security thinking must increasingly account for private infrastructure,” said Nate Fick, CEO of Endgame. “I’m excited about leveraging the solutions and technology that our mission partners depend on to help businesses with comprehensive command and control of their network operations.”</p>
